# Setup

Note 1: Chromium Browsers disable webrtc for non secure or non localhost servers. Safari does by default as well but can be changed by using the developer menu. Firefox as of now works fine.

Note 2: This must be deployed to a web server for testing. It can be localhost but just opening the files will not work due to the ajax requests.

1. Install Apache/tomcat or a program like XAMPP
2. Extract into htdocs/webapps (see documentation for your installation)
